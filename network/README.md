# Network Package

This directory is largely based on the example code provided in TTK4145's course resources: https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/tree/master/network

## Modifications

Some small adjustments may have been made to integrate the code into this project's structure,
such as:
- Updated import paths to match the local module layout
- Adapted configuration to use values from config.go
- In peers.go:
    - Peer IDs changed from string to int for consistency with project architecture.
    - Simplified logic for tracking New, Lost, and Peers.

## Original Author

The original implementation was developed and maintained by the TTK4145 course at NTNU.
